"""Fitting a sketch onto Therion's own layout of the survey.

Therion lays the survey out itself, closing loops and (in an extended
elevation) breaking them where its extend flags say. A sketch from the
phone was drawn on the phone's layout, which agrees with Therion's except
for a shift, unless loop closure or a different loop break moves some
stations. So each station's offset sketch -> Therion is worked out, and
stations whose offsets agree are grouped. One group means the sketch fits
as it is; several mean it must be split, one scrap per group, or Therion
will stretch the drawing between stations that have moved apart.

Therion's layout comes from `tools/thconfig-layout`, which writes
output/layout-plan.xvi and output/layout-extended.xvi.
